# Canada-2019
## Last updated: 5 Jan 2019
This is the repository for the Election StatSheet 2019 Canadian election forecast. Hooray!

Current status: figuring out how I actually plan to model this. Does anyone know how to use spTransform() to change a shapefile to Lambert Conformal Conic projection?

### What's in the box?
- **Code**: All scripts, including data processing, model building, simulation, etc.
- **Data**: Raw data downloaded from websites (see repo wiki). After processing, the processed versions are saved to the Processed directory. Also, shapefiles for creating maps.
- **Miscellanea**: For now, these are just images I want to add to the wiki.
